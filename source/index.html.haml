      My name is

      I'm currently working in Jacksonville, FL for Adecco's
      = link_to "innovation lab Ignite,", "http://www.ignitewithus.com/",  target: "_blank"
      as an Experience Designer and UX Developer. At Ignite, I work on two small product teams developing our apps' brand strategies, wireframing user flows, designing comps / prints, and pushing UI components and UX views for our frontend rails apps.

      In my spare time I co-found, design and build

        But!.....
      I would love to join the Basecamp team. I was inspired by the workshop at
      = link_to "KYN", "http://jacksonville.aiga.org/event/des-dev-assemble/", target: "_blank"
      and humbled by your talk on how designers and devs work together at Basecamp. And I'm pretty sure Javan kicked my butt at shuffleboard during Brooklyn Beta. I've used your products religiously over the last 8+ years working as a designer, and Basecamp sounds like the perfect job for me. When I found your job post today, I couldn't wait to spin up a
      = link_to "Middleman app", "https://github.com/daniloq/hire-me", target: "_blank"
      and knock out a quick page to send ya'lls way.
    %p
      I'm a great fit for your work environment because I worked in similar set ups in a Senior role for the past

      I'm a passionate scholar of product development, and
      %strong I'm easy to work with and always a work horse.
      I like things thought out, done right, and delivered on-time.

      I think Chicago is a beautiful city, but I would love the opportunity to give Jacksonville's tech community just a little bit more cred by representing Basecamp.

      P.S. I've been a die hard

      fan since I was 5 years old.
